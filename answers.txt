The Company

Description: Savin Chimie Hormoz Company stands as a dynamic and formidable force in the realm of international trade, specializing in the export of minerals and metals, the import of critical industrial supplies, the production of agricultural fertilizers, and the provision of high-level logistics services. The company's identity is fundamentally intertwined with that of its parent organization, the FARSA Group. This association is not merely a corporate formality; it is the bedrock of our operational stability, financial credibility, and long-term strategic vision.
The FARSA Group, headquartered in Tehran, has been a cornerstone of Iranian industry for over three decades. Established with a clear mission to identify and cultivate valuable investment targets and business opportunities throughout Iran and the broader MENA region, the group has grown into a diversified conglomerate. The group's portfolio is vast and impactful, with active and significant investments in several key sectors: Oil and Gas, involving both upstream exploration and downstream distribution; Petrochemicals, covering the production of basic chemicals and specialized polymers; Textiles, from raw material processing to finished garment manufacturing; Mining, with direct ownership and stakes in various mineral deposits; Construction, undertaking large-scale infrastructure and development projects; and Tourism and Entertainment, developing hospitality and leisure destinations. The FARSA Group employs a workforce exceeding one thousand individuals, a testament to its scale and economic impact.
The corporate philosophy of the FARSA Group, which is deeply embedded in the DNA of Savin Chimie Hormoz, emphasizes that superior business outcomes are only achievable through the creation, maintenance, and continuous refinement of a world-class business model. This model is built upon three fundamental pillars: the leveraging of highly capable and expert human resources, the implementation of industry-best management practices and operational protocols, and an unwavering commitment to continuously improving performance efficiency across all metrics. This philosophy translates into a tangible promise for our clients: when you engage with Savin Chimie Hormoz, you are not just dealing with a trader; you are engaging with a professionally managed, strategically agile, and financially robust organization that honors its commitments.
The mission of Savin Chimie Hormoz is to function as a strategic bridge, connecting global industrial and agricultural demand with reliable, high-quality, and competitively priced supply chains. We leverage Iran's abundant natural resources, particularly its rich and varied mineral wealth, and combine this with our integrated logistics capabilities to create unmatched value, efficiency, and security for our international partners. We aim to de-risk our clients' supply chains by providing a single, trustworthy source for a diverse range of essential materials.
Our vision for the future is to be universally recognized as the most trusted, innovative, and comprehensive trading and supply chain partner in the region for minerals, industrial inputs, and agricultural solutions. We strive to be the first name that comes to mind for any international entity seeking a reliable conduit to the markets of Iran and the wider Middle East.
Our core competencies are what truly differentiate us in the marketplace. First, we provide integrated supply chain solutions. Unlike many competitors who merely act as intermediaries, we control multiple critical links in the chain. This includes influence at the source, through our affiliations with group mines and long-standing relationships with other producers, and extends directly to the point of export via our owned and operated warehouse facility at Bandar Abbas port. This vertical integration reduces intermediary inefficiencies, mitigates risk, and provides our clients with greater transparency and control.
Second, we operate on a foundation of deep technical expertise. Our team is not composed solely of business graduates and traders; we employ metallurgists, chemical engineers, mineral processing experts, and agronomists. This allows us to provide consultative support to our clients. We can discuss flotation reagent schemes, cathode purity levels, fertilizer nutrient release profiles, and warehouse load-bearing capacities with authoritative knowledge. We move beyond simple price negotiations to become a true technical partner, helping our clients optimize their processes and improve their own bottom lines.
Third, our strategic asset base provides a tangible competitive advantage. The 20,000 square meter warehouse facility we own in Bandar Abbas is not just a storage shed; it is a strategic logistical choke point and a critical company asset. It provides us with a level of control over scheduling, cargo safety, and consolidation that is unavailable to asset-light competitors. This warehouse acts as a secure buffer, ensuring smooth operations even in the face of shipping delays or production fluctuations.
Finally, our quality assurance protocol is rigorous and multi-stage. It begins with the meticulous vetting of our supplier and manufacturing partners, often involving audits and certifications. It continues through the production process with batch sampling and testing. It culminates in a pre-shipment inspection regime, often conducted by internationally recognized third-party surveyors, to ensure that every product that leaves our control meets the agreed-upon international standards and client specifications. This end-to-end quality focus is a non-negotiable aspect of our corporate identity.

Metals & Minerals Export

Description: Savin Chimie Hormoz is a primary and leading exporter of a wide spectrum of metals and minerals, sourced directly from Iran's rich and geologically diverse mines, as well as from our affiliated processing plants. We ensure that all our products adhere to strict international quality standards, making them suitable for the most demanding global industrial applications.
Copper Products:
Our copper portfolio is comprehensive, covering the material from its most basic refined form to highly processed value-added products.
- Copper Cathode: This is the primary form of refined copper, the starting point for most copper-based products. Our cathodes conform to the ASTM B115 standard for Grade 1 electrolytic copper. The typical purity level is a minimum of 99.99% copper. The physical form is that of rectangular plates, which are then stacked and compactly bundled onto sturdy wooden pallets for secure handling and shipping. These bundles are designed to be moved by forklift and are ideally suited for containerized ocean freight. The cathodes are sourced directly from major Iranian smelters that operate advanced electrolytic refining processes.
- Continuous Cast Copper Wire Rod: This is a value-added product manufactured by melting cathodes and casting them into a continuous rod form. Our wire rod complies with ASTM B49 and European EN 1977 standards, specifically grade CW009A. The standard diameter offered is 8 millimeters, though other diameters can be produced upon request. A key performance indicator for wire rod is its electrical conductivity, and our product typically exceeds 101% IACS (International Annealed Copper Standard), making it ideal for high-efficiency electrical applications. The rod is supplied in long, continuous lengths that are coiled onto large, robust steel spools. Each spool is then carefully wrapped in heavy-duty, waterproof plastic wrapping to protect the copper from corrosion during transit and storage.
- Copper Wire and Cable: We export a wide array of copper wire and cable products. This includes building wire such as THHN and THWN types, which are used for internal wiring in residential and commercial buildings. We also supply power cables with XLPE (Cross-Linked Polyethylene) insulation for transmitting electricity over longer distances, and control cables for instrumentation and automation systems. These products can be manufactured to meet various international standards, including British Standards (BS), International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) standards, and American ANSI/UL standards. We offer a high degree of customization, allowing clients to order specific conductor sizes, insulation materials, sheathing compounds, and colors.
- Copper Profiles and Sections: These are custom-shaped copper products created through processes like extrusion and rolling. Common examples include copper busbars, which are flat, bar-shaped conductors used in electrical switchgear, distribution boards, and transformers for their excellent conductivity and thermal properties. We also supply copper tubes for plumbing and heat exchanger applications, and custom angles or other structural shapes for architectural and industrial uses.
The sourcing and quality control for our copper products are systematic. We work directly with ISO-certified smelters and manufacturers. For every lot of cathodes, a Mill Test Certificate is provided, detailing the chemical composition and confirming adherence to the ASTM B115 standard. For wire rod, random samples from production batches are tested for critical parameters including surface quality and smoothness, precise diameter tolerance, and electrical conductivity. Our standard export packaging is specifically engineered to prevent corrosion, physical damage, and moisture ingress during the rigors of international ocean freight. Cathodes are typically shipped in 20-foot or 40-foot dry containers. Wire rod coils are carefully stowed in 20-foot containers to prevent movement during transit.
Lead and Zinc Products:
We offer both lead and zinc in refined metal form and as raw concentrates for further processing.
- Refined Lead Ingots: We supply refined lead ingots with a typical purity of 99.97% minimum, with 99.99% purity available for more sensitive applications. The standard specification met is ASTM B29. The ingots are cast into standard, easy-to-handle blocks, each weighing approximately 25 kilograms. These ingots are primarily used in the manufacture of lead-acid batteries for automobiles and industrial backup power systems, as well as for radiation shielding in medical and nuclear facilities.
- Special High Grade Zinc Ingots: Our zinc ingots are of Special High Grade (SHG), with a purity of 99.995% minimum. This high purity is essential for applications like continuous galvanizing of steel sheets. The product conforms to ASTM B6 and EN 1179 standards. SHG zinc ingots are the raw material for the galvanizing industry, die-casting alloys for the automotive industry, and for the production of brass.
- Lead and Zinc Concentrates: We are also a direct supplier of flotation concentrates sourced from group-associated mines and other trusted partners. These are the raw, beneficiated ores resulting from the mineral processing of mined rock. Typical specifications for Zinc Concentrate would be a Zinc (Zn) content greater than 50%, with controlled levels of impurities like Lead (Pb) below 2% and Iron (Fe) below 8%. For Lead Concentrate, the Lead (Pb) content would be greater than 60%, with Zinc (Zn) below 5%. These concentrates are shipped with controlled moisture content to prevent liquefaction during sea voyage. Packaging can be in large, one-ton bulk sacks or, for very large orders, can be loaded directly into shipping containers as bulk material.
Aluminum Supply Chain:
We operate a unique and fully integrated "Mine-to-Market" model for aluminum, which differentiates us from simple metal traders.
- The Integrated Model: This model involves three distinct stages. In Stage 1, the Import Phase, we procure raw Alumina (Al₂O₃), which is the intermediate product derived from bauxite ore, from international sources. In Stage 2, the Local Production Phase, this alumina is shipped to our partner smelters within Iran, who use the energy-intensive Hall-Héroult process to reduce the alumina into primary aluminum metal. In Stage 3, the Export Phase, we take possession of the value-added aluminum products and manage their export to international markets.
- Export Products: The products we export include Aluminum Alloy Ingots, such as A360 and A380, which are specifically formulated for pressure die-casting to produce complex, thin-walled components for the automotive and consumer electronics industries. These are supplied in standard molds, each weighing around 8 kilograms. We also export Aluminum Billets, typically from the 6xxx series, which are long, cylindrical logs used as the feedstock for extrusion presses. These extrusions become architectural profiles for windows and doors, heat sinks, and automotive parts. Furthermore, we supply EC Grade (Electrically Conductive) Aluminum Wire Rod, which serves as a cost-effective alternative to copper in electrical transmission and distribution lines.
Iron Ore and Steel Chain Products:
We are a key supplier of raw materials to the global steel industry.
- Iron Ore Concentrate: This is a fine, powdered product resulting from the beneficiation of crude iron ore. The iron content, reported as Fe, typically ranges from 60% to 65%. The particle size is very fine, usually specified as -325 mesh or -0.044 millimeters, which is optimal for the pelletizing process. The product is carefully controlled for impurities such as Silica (SiO2), Alumina (Al2O3), Phosphorus (P), and Sulfur (S), as these can negatively impact the efficiency of the blast furnace and the quality of the final steel.
- Iron Ore Pellets: Pellets are a refined form of iron ore concentrate. The fine concentrate is mixed with binders and rolled into small, durable balls, which are then hardened by firing in a kiln. Our pellets have a high iron content, typically over 67%. Their size is uniformly controlled between 9 and 16 millimeters in diameter. The key advantages of pellets are their high mechanical strength, which prevents disintegration during shipping and handling, and their uniform size and porosity, which allows for a uniform gas flow and highly efficient operation inside a blast furnace.
- Direct Reduced Iron (DRI) / Sponge Iron: This product is a form of iron produced from the direct reduction of iron ore (in pellet or lump form) by a reducing gas (often derived from natural gas). The key metric is its metallization, which indicates the percentage of iron that has been reduced to metallic form; our DRI typically has a metallization rate greater than 92%. The carbon content can be adjusted according to client needs, usually between 1.5% and 3.5%. DRI is used primarily as a high-quality, low-residual feedstock for Electric Arc Furnaces (EAF) in mini-mills, serving as a clean and efficient alternative to scrap metal.
Chromite and Mica Iron Oxide:
We supply specialized industrial minerals from secure sources.
- Chromite: Chromite is the sole commercial source of chromium. We supply it in both lump form (sized between 10 and 80 millimeters) and as a fine concentrate (typically -100 mesh). The key chemical parameters are the Chromium Oxide (Cr2O3) content, which ranges from 40% to 48%, and the critical Chromium-to-Iron ratio (Cr:Fe), which can vary from 2.0:1 to 3.0:1 depending on the source and application. For metallurgical grade chromite, used in producing ferrochrome for stainless steel, the Silica (SiO2) content is kept low, typically below 5%.
- Mica Iron Oxide: We have exclusive access to the output of Mica Iron Oxide mines related to the FARSA Group. This product is supplied as a fine powder in various micron sizes, such as 45 micrometers and 90 micrometers. Its key property is its lamellar, or plate-like, particle structure. When used in paints and coatings, these microscopic plates align parallel to the substrate, creating a physical barrier that is highly effective at preventing moisture and oxygen from reaching the underlying steel, thus providing superior anti-corrosive protection. Its applications are primarily in heavy-duty industrial primers, marine coatings, and as a pigment in colored concrete and roofing materials.

Industrial Imports

Description: Savin Chimie Hormoz plays a vital role in sustaining and enhancing the productivity of Iran's industrial base by importing essential materials, chemicals, and equipment that are not produced locally or are required for their superior quality.
Graphite Electrodes:
These are large, cylindrical carbon products that are consumable components in Electric Arc Furnaces (EAF), which are used for recycling scrap steel and producing new steel.
- Detailed Grades and Applications:
- Ultra High Power (UHP): This is the highest performance grade, designed for the most intensive EAF operations with very high current loads. UHP electrodes are characterized by their lowest electrical resistivity, highest bulk density, and superior thermal shock resistance. They are engineered to withstand maximum current densities exceeding 30 Amperes per square centimeter. Their use minimizes breakage and consumption per ton of steel produced, leading to lower operating costs for the steelmaker.
- High Power (HP): This grade is suitable for standard EAF operations and is also commonly used in Ladle Furnaces for secondary steel refining. HP electrodes offer a balanced performance and are a cost-effective solution for many steel plants that do not operate at the extreme limits of UHP technology.
- Regular Power (RP): These electrodes are used for less intensive electrochemical applications, such as submerged arc furnaces used for producing silicon metals and ferroalloys.
- Technical Specifications (Typical for UHP Grade):
- Specific Electrical Resistance: Less than 5.5 micro-ohm-meters.
- Bulk Density: Greater than 1.68 grams per cubic centimeter.
- Elastic Modulus: Less than 9.5 Gigapascals (indicating a degree of flexibility to resist thermal stress).
- Thermal Expansion Coefficient: Less than 0.8 x 10⁻⁶ per degree Celsius.
- Sourcing and Branding: We are the exclusive Iranian representative and supply partner for one of the world's premier graphite electrode manufacturers (e.g., GrafTech, Showa Denko, etc. – the specific brand can be inserted here). This exclusive partnership guarantees our clients a consistent supply of top-tier quality products, backed by the technical support and R&D capabilities of a global leader.
Chemical Reagents for Mineral Processing:
This is a sophisticated product line where we act as a technical solution provider. These specialty chemicals are used to separate valuable minerals from worthless gangue material, primarily through the froth flotation process.
- In-Depth Product Categories and Functions:
- Collectors: These are organic molecules that selectively adsorb onto the surface of the target mineral particles, making them hydrophobic (water-repellent).
- Xanthates (e.g., Potassium Amyl Xanthate - PAX, Sodium Isopropyl Xanthate - SIPX): These are the most common and workhorse collectors for sulfide ores. Short-chain xanthates like Potassium Ethyl Xanthate are powerful but less selective, while long-chain versions like PAX are more selective for copper and lead sulfides.
- Dithiophosphates (e.g., Aero 3477): These are often used as secondary or co-collectors alongside xanthates. They can improve overall recovery and are particularly effective for gold and some copper ores, offering better selectivity against iron sulfide gangue like pyrite.
- Thionocarbamates (e.g., Isopropyl Ethyl Thionocarbamate - IPETC): These are highly selective collectors for copper sulfide minerals, especially against pyrite. They are preferred in circuits where a high-grade copper concentrate is the primary objective.
- Frothers: These are surface-active agents that reduce the surface tension of water, enabling the formation of a stable froth column in the flotation cell.
- MIBC (Methyl Isobutyl Carbinol): This is a widely used "selective" frother. It produces a froth characterized by relatively small, brittle bubbles that are not too persistent. This helps in achieving a cleaner mineral concentrate.
- Polyglycol-type Frothers (e.g., Dowfroth 250): These are "powerful" frothers that generate a more stable and persistent froth column. They are used when a tougher froth is needed to carry heavier or coarser particles.
- Modifiers: These chemicals are used to control the chemical environment in the flotation pulp to optimize the action of collectors and frothers.
- pH Modifiers: The most critical modifiers. Lime (CaO) or Soda Ash (Na2CO3) are used to raise the pH (make the slurry alkaline), which is often necessary for effective sulfide mineral separation. Sulphuric Acid (H2SO4) is used to lower the pH (make it acidic).
- Activators: Chemicals that alter the surface of a mineral to allow a collector to adsorb. A prime example is Copper Sulphate (CuSO4), which is used to "activate" the sphalerite (zinc sulfide) mineral, allowing it to be collected by xanthates after the lead and copper have been removed.
- Depressants: Chemicals that prevent the collector from adsorbing onto specific mineral surfaces. Sodium Cyanide (NaCN) and Zinc Sulphate (ZnSO4) are classic depressants used to prevent the flotation of pyrite and sphalerite, respectively, thereby improving the selectivity of the process.
- Technical Support: Our value proposition extends beyond just selling chemicals. Our metallurgists and chemical engineers can help diagnose issues in a client's flotation plant, such as low recovery of the valuable metal, poor grade (purity) of the final concentrate, or high reagent consumption. We can then recommend a tailored reagent scheme, including the optimal mix of collectors and frothers, their precise dosage rates, and the most effective points of addition in the flotation circuit.
Machinery and Spare Parts:
We support the continuous operation of heavy industries by supplying critical machinery, equipment, and genuine spare parts.
- Served Sectors: Our clients in this segment include Mining companies, Mineral Processing plants, Steel mills, Petrochemical complexes, and Fertilizer production facilities.
- Product Examples: The range is vast. It includes wear-resistant parts like crusher liners, mill liners, and pump impellers that are subject to constant abrasion. It covers processing equipment such as filters, hydro-cyclones, thickeners, and conveyor systems. We also supply components for power transmission, including industrial gearboxes, large-diameter bearings, and electric motors. Furthermore, we can source instrumentation like pressure sensors, flow meters, and automated control valves.
- Sourcing Strategy: We maintain partnerships with both Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) and highly reputable aftermarket manufacturers located in industrial hubs across Europe, India, and China. This allows us to offer our clients a choice between OEM-assured quality and cost-effective, high-performance alternatives.

Agricultural Fertilizers - Enhancing Crop Yield and Soil Health

Description: Savin Chimie Hormoz has strategically expanded into the agricultural sector, establishing a new division dedicated to providing solutions that enhance crop productivity and promote sustainable farming practices.
Product Lines:
We offer a balanced portfolio of both conventional and modern fertilizer solutions.
- Chemical Fertilizers: These provide essential primary nutrients in readily available forms for plant uptake.
- NPK Fertilizers: These are compound fertilizers containing varying ratios of the three primary macronutrients: Nitrogen (N) for leaf and stem growth, Phosphorus (P) for root development and energy transfer, and Potassium (K) for overall plant health and disease resistance. We offer various blends such as 20-20-20 for balanced nutrition, 15-15-15 for general use, and 10-20-30 for crops with high potassium demand like fruits and potatoes. These are available in a prilled (small, spherical) or granular form for easy mechanical application.
- Urea (46-0-0): This is a concentrated nitrogen fertilizer, containing 46% Nitrogen. It is the most widely used nitrogen fertilizer in the world due to its high nutrient content and cost-effectiveness. We supply it in a granular form.
- DAP (Diammonium Phosphate - 18-46-0): This is a high-phosphorus fertilizer, containing 18% Nitrogen and 46% Phosphorus. It is an excellent source of readily available phosphate for stimulating strong root systems, particularly in the early stages of plant growth.
- Biological Fertilizers: These are modern, eco-friendly products that utilize beneficial microorganisms to improve soil health and nutrient availability.
- Nitrogen-Fixing Bacteria (e.g., Rhizobium for legumes, Azotobacter for non-legumes): These bacteria form a symbiotic relationship with plants or live freely in the soil, converting atmospheric nitrogen (N2) into ammonia, a form of nitrogen that plants can use. This significantly reduces the need for synthetic nitrogen fertilizers.
- Phosphate-Solubilizing Bacteria (e.g., Bacillus megaterium, Pseudomonas striata): These microorganisms secrete organic acids that dissolve locked-up forms of phosphorus in the soil (such as tricalcium phosphate), making this vital nutrient available for plant roots to absorb.
- Mycorrhizal Fungi: These fungi form a symbiotic association with plant roots, effectively extending the root system with a vast network of fungal hyphae. This greatly increases the root's surface area for absorbing water and nutrients, particularly phosphorus and micronutrients, from a much larger volume of soil. This enhances plant drought tolerance and reduces fertilizer requirements.
- Quality Control: Our fertilizer production facilities operate under ISO quality management systems. For chemical fertilizers, every production batch is laboratory-tested to verify the precise nutrient content. For biological fertilizers, we conduct rigorous testing to ensure high microbial counts (Colony Forming Units per gram) and viability, guaranteeing that the product is alive and effective when it reaches the farmer.
Future Portfolio Expansion:
Our commitment to the agricultural sector is long-term. Our product roadmap includes the planned introduction of a full suite of Crop Protection Products, including Herbicides for weed control, Insecticides for pest management, and Fungicides to prevent fungal diseases. We are also evaluating the addition of Plant Growth Regulators (PGRs), which are chemicals used to modify plant growth patterns, such as controlling height or promoting flowering.

The Inquiry to Order Process:
1. Inquiry: A client submits a product inquiry through our website contact form, by email to our sales team, or via the AI chatbot. The inquiry should specify the product of interest, desired quantity, and any relevant specifications.
2. Quotation: Our sales team, in consultation with our technical experts if needed, prepares and sends a formal Proforma Invoice (PI) to the client. The PI is a detailed document that includes a full description of the product with specifications, the unit price and total price, the agreed Incoterm (e.g., FOB Bandar Abbas, CIF Jebel Ali, etc.), the quantity, the estimated delivery time, and the detailed payment terms.
3. Order Confirmation: The client reviews, signs, and returns the Proforma Invoice to confirm the order. Simultaneously, the client arranges for payment as per the agreed terms, which is typically either an advance payment via wire transfer or the opening of an Irrevocable Letter of Credit (L/C) in our favor from their bank.
4. Production/Procurement and Inspection: Upon receipt of the advance payment or the original L/C, we initiate the process. For exports, we coordinate with our suppliers or group companies to allocate the goods. For imports, we place the order with our international supplier. At this stage, if required by the client, we can arrange for a pre-shipment inspection by an independent surveyor like SGS or Bureau Veritas to verify quality and quantity before shipping.
5. Shipping and Documentation: Once the goods are ready and have passed any required inspections, we book the shipping space with a shipping line. We manage the loading of the container(s) at our warehouse or the supplier's location. After the vessel sails, we prepare and courier the full set of original shipping documents to the client. This set typically includes the Bill of Lading (the title of goods), Commercial Invoice, Packing List, Certificate of Origin, and any specific inspection certificates.
6. Final Payment and Document Release: For transactions using an L/C, the bank handles the payment against the presentation of compliant documents. For other payment terms, the remaining balance is settled upon our providing a copy of the shipping documents, after which the originals are released.
Standard Payment Terms:
To balance risk and facilitate smooth transactions, we typically propose the following terms:
- Standard for New Clients: 30% of the total invoice value as an advance payment via Telegraphic Transfer (TT) before production/procurement commences. The remaining 70% balance is to be paid against the copy of the shipping documents before the original documents are released.
- Alternative Secure Method: 100% payment by Irrevocable Letter of Credit (L/C) at sight. This means the client's bank guarantees payment as soon as we present the complying shipping documents to our bank.
- For Established Clients: After a successful transaction history, we can negotiate more flexible terms, such as a Telegraphic Transfer with a short credit period (e.g., 30 days from the Bill of Lading date).
